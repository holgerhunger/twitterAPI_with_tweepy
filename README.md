# twitterAPI_with_tweepy
## Access to the free Twitter API v2 with Tweepy.

There are only three API endpoints available in free access.
They are called one after the other in this demo program.
First the account and username are requested and displayed.
Then a tweet is sent.
After 20 seconds the tweet is deleted again.
